"""eval_live – lightweight library for registering visualizations.

Create a Registry, add graphs and tables to it, and assign it to the
module-level ``registry`` variable so eval-live can find it.

Quick start::

    import eval_live

    reg = eval_live.Registry()
    reg.graph("My Graph", my_graph)
    reg.table("Mean Timing", mean_timing, filter_source=mean_timing_filter)
    eval_live.registry = reg

Graphs
------
A graph function receives the data dict and returns a matplotlib Figure::

    def my_graph(data):
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.bar(["a", "b"], [1, 2])
        return fig

Tables
------
A table function receives the data dict and returns a list of row dicts.
These are rendered as filterable HTML tables below the raw data tables::

    def mean_timing(data):
        import math
        result = []
        for row in data["timings"]:
            times = row["timing_list"]
            n = len(times)
            mean = sum(times) / n if n else 0
            result.append({"file": row["file"], "mean": round(mean, 4), "n": n})
        return result

Filters (filter_source)
-----------------------
When the user types in a computed table's filter box, only some computed
rows remain visible.  A ``filter_source`` function lets you propagate that
filter back to the *raw* data tables.

It receives two arguments:

- **filtered_rows**: the list of computed row dicts that are currently
  visible after the user's text filter.
- **data**: the *original* (unfiltered) data dict.

It returns a **new data dict** with the appropriate raw rows removed.
eval-live then hides raw-table rows that aren't in the returned data.

Example: if your computed table has one row per (file, treatment) pair,
the filter_source narrows raw timings to matching pairs::

    def mean_timing_filter(filtered_rows, data):
        # Build the set of primary keys the user wants to see
        keys = {(r["file"], r["treatment"]) for r in filtered_rows}
        # Return data with only the matching raw rows
        return {
            **data,
            "timings": [r for r in data["timings"]
                        if (r["file"], r["treatment"]) in keys],
        }

If multiple computed tables each have a filter_source, they are chained:
each one narrows the data further.  A table without filter_source has no
effect on the raw tables when filtered.
